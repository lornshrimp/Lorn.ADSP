### Intrinsic in-game

Sponsor: The Trade Desk

**Background**

As intrinsic in-game inventory picks up momentum from both the supply side and the buy side, it's important for there to be a signal to accurately identify this nuanced inventory. The IAB recognized the lack of standards in the space recently by establishing specific<a href="https://www.iab.com/insights/iab-releases-intrinsic-in-game-iig-measurement-guidelines/"> measurement guidelines</a> in 2022 and this signal aims to further recognize this type of inventory as an established channel. 

**Goal**

The goal of this signal is to have all SSP's correctly identify intrinsic in-game inventory in order for the DSP or other parties to segment this inventory accordingly.

**Definition**

Ad space that modifies the environment of a game, such as a billboard or skin.
