# ads.cert v2.0:



**September 2021**

The beta draft of ads.cert 1.0 was released November 2018, but never was released as a standard for a number of reasons.
The IAB Tech Lab Cryptographic Security Foundations Working Group has decided to take ads.cert in a new direction, independent of OpenRTB 3.0 (and OpenRTB itself in some ways) and more directly modeled after other cryptographic security standards. The new specifications are available at [https://iabtechlab.com/ads-cert](https://iabtechlab.com/ads-cert)

The 1.0 beta draft can be found in this history of this file, but we recommend that everyone follow the new specifications.
